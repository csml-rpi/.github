## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Welcome to the Computational Scientific Machine Learning Lab (CSML) from the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering at RPI.

:sunglasses: What’s our mission?

:white_check_mark: Our mission is to pioneer advanced modeling and simulations in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering by harnessing the power of scientific machine learning.

:eight_pointed_black_star:What are our interests?

- Scientific machine learning for large-scale nonlinear systems
- Operator-theoretic modeling and control of fluid flows
- Generative AI for physical systems

:biohazard: For internal users:
- Useful tutorials [Discussions](https://github.com/csml-rpi/wiki/discussions) 
- Shared course resources [Course Resources](https://github.com/csml-rpi/shared-course-materials)
- Doctor qualifying exam resources [DQE](https://github.com/csml-rpi/wiki/discussions/12)
