## 🙋‍♀️ Welcome to the Computational Scientific Machine Learning Lab (CSML)

We are an interdisciplinary research group in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Our team develops scientific machine‑learning approaches for modeling, simulation and control of complex physical systems—combining computational physics, operator‑theoretic methods and generative AI. For a deeper look at our projects, please visit our website [here](http://pswpswpsw.github.io/).

😎 **What’s our mission?**

- ✅ To pioneer advanced modeling and simulation techniques in mechanical and aerospace engineering by harnessing the power of scientific machine learning. We focus on forward/inverse modeling, control and generative models for complex physical systems.

✴️ **What are our interests?**

- Scientific machine learning for large‑scale nonlinear systems  
- Operator‑theoretic modeling and control of fluid flows  
- Generative AI for physical systems  
- Automated and democratized CFD workflows (e.g., our Foam‑Agent multi‑agent framework)  
- Training and fine‑tuning large language models for scientific computing (see our FoamGPT project)  
- Noise‑robust Koopman operators and dimensionality reduction using deep autoencoders
