## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Welcome to the Computational Scientific Machine Learning Lab (CSML) 

We are a research group from the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering at RPI. This website is our base on the internet. For information about what we are doing, please go [here](http://www.shaowupan.com/). 

:sunglasses: **What‚Äôs our mission?**

- :white_check_mark: Our mission is to pioneer advanced modeling and simulations in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering by harnessing the power of scientific machine learning.

:eight_pointed_black_star: **What are our interests?**

- Scientific machine learning for large-scale nonlinear systems
- Operator-theoretic modeling and control of fluid flows
- Generative AI for physical systems

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
